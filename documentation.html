<p>pgBadger - a fast PostgreSQL log analysis report</p>

<h3 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h3>

<p>Usage: pgbadger [options] logfile [...]</p>

<pre><code>        PostgreSQL log analyzer with fully detailed reports and graphs.</code></pre>

<p>Arguments:</p>

<pre><code>    logfile can be a single log file, a list of files, or a shell command
    returning a list of files. If you want to pass log content from stdin
    use - as filename. Note that input from stdin will not work with csvlog.</code></pre>

<p>Options:</p>

<pre><code>    -a | --average minutes : number of minutes to build the average graphs of
                             queries and connections. Default 5 minutes.
    -A | --histo-average min: number of minutes to build the histogram graphs
                             of queries. Default 60 minutes.
    -b | --begin datetime  : start date/time for the data to be parsed in log.
    -c | --dbclient host   : only report on entries for the given client host.
    -C | --nocomment       : remove comments like /* ... */ from queries.
    -d | --dbname database : only report on entries for the given database.
    -D | --dns-resolv      : client ip addresses are replaced by their DNS name.
                             Be warned that this can really slow down pgBadger.
    -e | --end datetime    : end date/time for the data to be parsed in log.
    -f | --format logtype  : possible values: syslog, syslog2, stderr, jsonlog,
                             cvs and pgbouncer. Use this option when pgBadger is
                             not able to auto-detect the log format.
    -G | --nograph         : disable graphs on HTML output. Enabled by default.
    -h | --help            : show this message and exit.
    -i | --ident name      : programname used as syslog ident. Default: postgres
    -I | --incremental     : use incremental mode, reports will be generated by
                             days in a separate directory, --outdir must be set.
    -j | --jobs number     : number of jobs to run at same time. Default is 1,
                             run as single process.
    -J | --Jobs number     : number of log file to parse in parallel. Default
                             is 1, run as single process.
    -l | --last-parsed file: allow incremental log parsing by registering the
                             last datetime and line parsed. Useful if you want
                             to watch errors since last run or if you want one
                             report per day with a log rotated each week.
    -L | --logfile-list file:file containing a list of log file to parse.
    -m | --maxlength size  : maximum length of a query, it will be restricted to
                             the given size. Default: no truncate
    -M | --no-multiline    : do not collect multiline statement to avoid garbage
                             especially on errors that generate a huge report.
    -n | --nohighlight     : disable SQL code highlighting.
    -N | --appname name    : only report on entries for given application name
    -o | --outfile filename: define the filename for the output. Default depends

                             With module JSON::XS installed, you can output file
                             in JSON format either.
                             To dump output to stdout use - as filename.
    -O | --outdir path     : directory where out file must be saved.
    -p | --prefix string   : the value of your custom log_line_prefix as
                             defined in your postgresql.conf. Only use it if you

                             in the pgBadger documentation, such as if your
                             prefix includes additional variables like client ip

                             remote logfile to parse locally the file.
    -R | --retention N     : number of weeks to keep in incremental mode. Default
                             to 0, disabled. Used to set the number of weeks to
                             keep in output directory. Older weeks and days
                             directory are automatically removed.

                                 -o ConnectTimeout=$ssh_timeout
                                 -o PreferredAuthentications=hostbased,publickey</code></pre>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code>        pgbadger /var/log/postgresql.log
        pgbadger /var/log/postgres.log.2.gz /var/log/postgres.log.1.gz 
                       /var/log/postgres.log
        pgbadger /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-2012-05-*
        pgbadger --exclude-query=&quot;^(COPY|COMMIT)&quot; /var/log/postgresql.log
        pgbadger -b &quot;2012-06-25 10:56:11&quot; -e &quot;2012-06-25 10:59:11&quot; 
                       /var/log/postgresql.log
        cat /var/log/postgres.log | pgbadger -
        # Log prefix with stderr log output
        perl pgbadger --prefix &#39;%t [%p]: usr=%u,dbase=%d,ip=%h&#39; 
                        /pglog/postgresql-2012-08-21*
        perl pgbadger --prefix &#39;%m %u@%d %p %r %a : &#39; /pglog/postgresql.log
        # Log line prefix with syslog log output
        perl pgbadger --prefix &#39;user=%u,db=%d,client=%h,appname=%a&#39; 
                        /pglog/postgresql-2012-08-21*
        # Use my 8 CPUs to parse my 10GB file faster, much faster
        perl pgbadger -j 8 /pglog/postgresql-9.1-main.log</code></pre>

<p>Generate Tsung sessions XML file with select queries only:</p>

<pre><code>    perl pgbadger -S -o sessions.tsung --prefix &#39;%t [%p]: user=%u,db=%d &#39; /pglog/postgresql-9.1.log</code></pre>

<p>Reporting errors every week by cron job:</p>

<pre><code>    30 23 * * 1 /usr/bin/pgbadger -q -w /var/log/postgresql.log -o /var/reports/pg_errors.html</code></pre>

<p>Generate report every week using incremental behavior:</p>

<pre><code>    0 4 * * 1 /usr/bin/pgbadger -q `find /var/log/ -mtime -7 -name &quot;postgresql.log*&quot;` 
        -o /var/reports/pg_errors-`date +%F`.html -l /var/reports/pgbadger_incremental_file.dat</code></pre>

<p>This supposes that your log file and HTML report are also rotated every week.</p>

<p>Or better, use the auto-generated incremental reports:</p>

<pre><code>    0 4 * * * /usr/bin/pgbadger -I -q /var/log/postgresql/postgresql.log.1 
        -O /var/www/pg_reports/</code></pre>

<p>will generate a report per day and per week.</p>

<p>In incremental mode, you can also specify the number of week to keep in the reports:</p>

<pre><code>    /usr/bin/pgbadger --retention 2 -I -q /var/log/postgresql/postgresql.log.1 
        -O /var/www/pg_reports/</code></pre>

<p>If you have a pg_dump at 23:00 and 13:00 each day during half an hour, you can use pgBadger as follow to exclude these period from the report:</p>

<pre><code>    pgbadger --exclude-time &quot;2013-09-.* (23|13):.*&quot; postgresql.log </code></pre>

<p>This will help avoid having COPY statements, as generated by pg_dump, on top of the list of slowest queries. You can also use --exclude-appname &quot;pg_dump&quot; to solve this problem in a simpler way.</p>

<p>You can also parse journalctl output just as if it was a log file:</p>

<pre><code>    pgbadger --journalctl &#39;journalctl -u postgresql-9.5&#39;</code></pre>

<p>or worst, call it from a remote host:</p>

<pre><code>    pgbadger -r 192.168.1.159 --journalctl &#39;journalctl -u postgresql-9.5&#39;</code></pre>

<p>you don&#39;t need to specify any log file at command line, but if you have other PostgreSQL log file to parse, you can add them as usual.</p>

<p>To rebuild all incremental html reports after, proceed as follow:</p>

<pre><code>    rm /path/to/reports/*.js
    rm /path/to/reports/*.css
    pgbadger -X -I -O /path/to/reports/ --rebuild</code></pre>

<p>it will also update all resource files (JS and CSS).</p>

<h3 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p>pgBadger is a PostgreSQL log analyzer built for speed with fully reports from your PostgreSQL log file. It&#39;s a single and small Perl script that outperforms any other PostgreSQL log analyzer.</p>

<p>It is written in pure Perl and uses a JavaScript library (flotr2) to draw graphs so that you don&#39;t need to install any additional Perl modules or other packages. Furthermore, this library gives us more features such as zooming. pgBadger also uses the Bootstrap JavaScript library and the FontAwesome webfont for better design. Everything is embedded.</p>

<p>pgBadger is able to autodetect your log file format (syslog, stderr, csvlog or jsonlog) if the file is long enough. It is designed to parse huge log files as well as compressed files. Supported compressed format are gzip, bzip2 and xz. For the xz format you must have an xz version upper than 5.05 that supports the --robot option. For the complete list of features see below.</p>

<p>All charts are zoomable and can be saved as PNG images.</p>

<p>You can also limit pgBadger to only report errors or remove any part of the report using command line options.</p>

<p>pgBadger supports any custom format set into the log_line_prefix directive of your postgresql.conf file as long as it at least specify the %t and %p patterns.</p>

<p>pgBadger allows parallel processing of a single log file or multiple files through the use of the -j option specifying the number of CPUs.</p>

<p>If you want to save system performance you can also use log_duration instead of log_min_duration_statement to have reports on duration and number of queries only.</p>

<h3 id="FEATURE">FEATURE</h3>

<p>pgBadger reports everything about your SQL queries:</p>

<pre><code>        Overall statistics.
        The most frequent waiting queries.
        Queries that waited the most.
        Queries generating the most temporary files.
        Queries generating the largest temporary files.
        The slowest queries.
        Queries that took up the most time.
        The most frequent queries.
        The most frequent errors.
        Histogram of query times.
        Histogram of sessions times.
        Users involved in top queries.
        Applications involved in top queries.
        Queries generating the most cancellation.
        Queries most cancelled.</code></pre>

<p>The following reports are also available with hourly charts divided into periods of five minutes:</p>

<pre><code>        SQL queries statistics.
        Temporary file statistics.
        Checkpoints statistics.
        Autovacuum and autoanalyze statistics.
        Cancelled queries.
        Error events (panic, fatal, error and warning).
        Error class distribution.</code></pre>

<p>There are also some pie charts about distribution of:</p>

<pre><code>        Locks statistics.
        Queries by type (select/insert/update/delete).
        Distribution of queries type per database/application
        Sessions per database/user/client/application.
        Connections per database/user/client/application.
        Autovacuum and autoanalyze per table.
        Queries per user and total duration per user.</code></pre>

<p>All charts are zoomable and can be saved as PNG images. SQL queries reported are highlighted and beautified automatically.</p>

<p>pgBadger is also able to parse PgBouncer log files and to create the following reports:</p>

<pre><code>        Request Throughput
        Bytes I/O Throughput
        Queries Average duration
        Simultaneous sessions
        Histogram of sessions times
        Sessions per database
        Sessions per user
        Sessions per host
        Established connections

        Connections per user
        Connections per host
        Most used reserved pools
        Most Frequent Errors/Events</code></pre>

<p>You can also have incremental reports with one report per day and a cumulative report per week. Two multiprocess modes are available to speed up log parsing, one using one core per log file, and the second using multiple cores to parse a single file. These modes can be combined.</p>

<p>Histogram granularity can be adjusted using the -A command line option. By default they will report the mean of each top queries/errors occurring per hour, but you can specify the granularity down to the minute.</p>

<p>pgBadger can also be used in a central place to parse remote log files using a passwordless SSH connection. This mode can be used with compressed files and in the multiprocess per file mode (-J) but can not be used with the CSV log format.</p>

<h3 id="REQUIREMENT">REQUIREMENT</h3>

<p>pgBadger comes as a single Perl script - you do not need anything other than a modern Perl distribution. Charts are rendered using a JavaScript library so you don&#39;t need anything other than a web browser. Your browser will do all the work.</p>

<p>If you planned to parse PostgreSQL CSV log files you might need some Perl Modules:</p>

<pre><code>        Text::CSV_XS - to parse PostgreSQL CSV log files.</code></pre>

<p>This module is optional, if you don&#39;t have PostgreSQL log in the CSV format you don&#39;t need to install it.</p>

<p>If you want to export statistics as JSON file you need an additional Perl module:</p>

<pre><code>        JSON::XS - JSON serialising/deserialising, done correctly and fast</code></pre>

<p>This module is optional, if you don&#39;t select the json output format you don&#39;t need to install it.</p>

<p>Compressed log file format is autodetected from the file extension. If pgBadger find a gz extension it will use the zcat utility, with a bz2 extension it will use bzcat and if the file extension is zip or xz then the unzip or xz utilities will be used.</p>

<p>If those utilities are not found in the PATH environment variable then use the --zcat command line option to change this path. For example:</p>

<pre><code>        --zcat=&quot;/usr/local/bin/gunzip -c&quot; or --zcat=&quot;/usr/local/bin/bzip2 -dc&quot;
        --zcat=&quot;C:\tools\unzip -p&quot;</code></pre>

<p>By default pgBadger will use the zcat, bzcat and unzip utilities following the file extension. If you use the default autodetection compress format you can mixed gz, bz2, xz or zip files. Specifying a custom value to --zcat option will remove this feature of mixed compressed format.</p>

<p>Note that multiprocessing can not be used with compressed files or CSV files as well as under Windows platform.</p>

<h3 id="INSTALLATION">INSTALLATION</h3>

<p>Download the tarball from GitHub and unpack the archive as follow:</p>

<pre><code>        tar xzf pgbadger-7.x.tar.gz
        cd pgbadger-7.x/
        perl Makefile.PL
        make &amp;&amp; sudo make install</code></pre>

<p>This will copy the Perl script pgbadger to /usr/local/bin/pgbadger by default and the man page into /usr/local/share/man/man1/pgbadger.1. Those are the default installation directories for &#39;site&#39; install.</p>

<p>If you want to install all under /usr/ location, use INSTALLDIRS=&#39;perl&#39; as an argument of Makefile.PL. The script will be installed into /usr/bin/pgbadger and the manpage into /usr/share/man/man1/pgbadger.1.</p>

<p>For example, to install everything just like Debian does, proceed as follows:</p>

<pre><code>        perl Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=vendor</code></pre>

<p>By default INSTALLDIRS is set to site.</p>

<h3 id="POSTGRESQL-CONFIGURATION">POSTGRESQL CONFIGURATION</h3>

<p>You must enable and set some configuration directives in your postgresql.conf before starting.</p>

<p>You must first enable SQL query logging to have something to parse:</p>

<pre><code>        log_min_duration_statement = 0</code></pre>

<p>Here every statement will be logged, on a busy server you may want to increase this value to only log queries with a longer duration. Note that if you have log_statement set to &#39;all&#39; nothing will be logged through the log_min_duration_statement directive. See the next chapter for more information.</p>

<p>pgBadger supports any custom format set into the log_line_prefix directive of your postgresql.conf file as long as it at least specify a time escape sequence (%t, %m or %n) and the process related escape sequence (%p or %c).</p>

<p>For example, with &#39;stderr&#39; log format, log_line_prefix must be at least:</p>

<pre><code>        log_line_prefix = &#39;%t [%p]: &#39;</code></pre>

<p>Log line prefix could add user, database name, application name and client ip address as follows:</p>

<pre><code>        log_line_prefix = &#39;%t [%p]: user=%u,db=%d,app=%a,client=%h &#39;</code></pre>

<p>or for syslog log file format:</p>

<pre><code>        log_line_prefix = &#39;user=%u,db=%d,app=%a,client=%h &#39;</code></pre>

<p>Log line prefix for stderr output could also be:</p>

<pre><code>        log_line_prefix = &#39;%t [%p]: [%l-1] db=%d,user=%u,app=%a,client=%h &#39;</code></pre>

<p>or for syslog output:</p>

<pre><code>        log_line_prefix = &#39;db=%d,user=%u,app=%a,client=%h &#39;</code></pre>

<p>Note: the session line [%l-1] in the examples above is just used to have the same stderr format than syslog but it is not mandatory. That mean that it is not used in pgBadger statistics / graphs. You can safely remove them from the log_line_prefix when log_destination is stderr.</p>

<p>You need to enable other parameters in postgresql.conf to get more information from your log files:</p>

<pre><code>        log_checkpoints = on
        log_connections = on
        log_disconnections = on
        log_lock_waits = on
        log_temp_files = 0
        log_autovacuum_min_duration = 0
        log_error_verbosity = default</code></pre>

<p>Do not enable log_statement as its log format will not be parsed by pgBadger.</p>

<p>Of course your log messages should be in English without locale support:</p>

<pre><code>        lc_messages=&#39;C&#39;</code></pre>

<p>but this is not only recommended by pgBadger.</p>

<h3 id="log_min_duration_statement-log_duration-and-log_statement">log_min_duration_statement vs log_duration+log_statement</h3>

<p>If you want the query statistics to include the actual query strings, you must set log_min_duration_statement to 0 or more milliseconds.</p>

<p>If you just want to report duration and number of queries and don&#39;t want all details about queries, set log_min_duration_statement to -1 to disable it and enable log_duration in your postgresql.conf file. If you want to add the most common request report you can either choose to set log_min_duration_statement to a higher value or choose to enable log_statement.</p>

<p>Enabling log_min_duration_statement will add reports about slowest queries and queries that took up the most time. Take care that if you have log_statement set to &#39;all&#39; nothing will be logged with log_line_prefix.</p>

<h3 id="PARALLEL-PROCESSING">PARALLEL PROCESSING</h3>

<p>To enable parallel processing you just have to use the -j N option where N is the number of cores you want to use.</p>

<p>pgBadger will then proceed as follow:</p>

<pre><code>        for each log file
            chunk size = int(file size / N)
            look at start/end offsets of these chunks
            fork N processes and seek to the start offset of each chunk
                each process will terminate when the parser reach the end offset
                of its chunk
                each process write stats into a binary temporary file
           wait for all children has terminated
        All binary temporary files generated will then be read and loaded into
        memory to build the html output.</code></pre>

<p>With that method, at start/end of chunks pgBadger may truncate or omit a maximum of N queries per log file which is an insignificant gap if you have millions of queries in your log file. The chance that the query that you were looking for is lost is near 0, this is why I think this gap is livable. Most of the time the query is counted twice but truncated.</p>

<p>When you have many small log files and many CPUs it is speedier to dedicate one core to one log file at a time. To enable this behavior you have to use option -J N instead. With 200 log files of 10MB each the use of the -J option starts being really interesting with 8 Cores. Using this method you will be sure not to lose any queries in the reports.</p>

<p>He are a benchmark done on a server with 8 CPUs and a single file of 9.5GB.</p>

<pre><code>         Option |  1 CPU  | 2 CPU | 4 CPU | 8 CPU
        --------+---------+-------+-------+------
           -j   | 1h41m18 | 50m25 | 25m39 | 15m58
           -J   | 1h41m18 | 54m28 | 41m16 | 34m45</code></pre>

<p>With 200 log files of 10MB each and a total of 2GB the results are slightly different:</p>

<pre><code>         Option | 1 CPU | 2 CPU | 4 CPU | 8 CPU
        --------+-------+-------+-------+------
           -j   | 20m15 |  9m56 |  5m20 | 4m20
           -J   | 20m15 |  9m49 |  5m00 | 2m40</code></pre>

<p>So it is recommended to use -j unless you have hundreds of small log files and can use at least 8 CPUs.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: when you are using parallel parsing pgBadger will generate a lot of temporary files in the /tmp directory and will remove them at the end, so do not remove those files unless pgBadger is not running. They are all named with the following template tmp_pgbadgerXXXX.bin so they can be easily identified.</p>

<h3 id="INCREMENTAL-REPORTS">INCREMENTAL REPORTS</h3>

<p>pgBadger includes an automatic incremental report mode using option -I or --incremental. When running in this mode, pgBadger will generate one report per day and a cumulative report per week. Output is first done in binary format into the mandatory output directory (see option -O or --outdir), then in HTML format for daily and weekly reports with a main index file.</p>

<p>The main index file will show a dropdown menu per week with a link to each week report and links to daily reports of each week.</p>

<p>For example, if you run pgBadger as follows based on a daily rotated file:</p>

<pre><code>    0 4 * * * /usr/bin/pgbadger -I -q /var/log/postgresql/postgresql.log.1 \
        -O /var/www/pg_reports/</code></pre>

<p>you will have all daily and weekly reports for the full running period.</p>

<p>In this mode pgBadger will create an automatic incremental file in the output directory, so you don&#39;t have to use the -l option unless you want to change the path of that file. This means that you can run pgBadger in this mode each day on a log file rotated each week, and it will not count the log entries twice.</p>

<p>To save disk space you may want to use the -X or --extra-files command line option to force pgBadger to write JavaScript and CSS to separate files in the output directory. The resources will then be loaded using script and link tags.</p>

<h3 id="BINARY-FORMAT">BINARY FORMAT</h3>

<p>Using the binary format it is possible to create custom incremental and cumulative reports. For example, if you want to refresh a pgBadger report each hour from a daily PostgreSQL log file, you can proceed by running each hour the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>    pgbadger --last-parsed .pgbadger_last_state_file -o sunday/hourX.bin /var/log/pgsql/postgresql-Sun.log</code></pre>

<p>to generate the incremental data files in binary format. And to generate the fresh HTML report from that binary file:</p>

<pre><code>    pgbadger sunday/*.bin</code></pre>

<p>Or as another example, if you generate one log file per hour and you want reports to be rebuilt each time the log file is rotated, proceed as follows:</p>

<pre><code>        pgbadger -o day1/hour01.bin /var/log/pgsql/pglog/postgresql-2012-03-23_10.log
        pgbadger -o day1/hour02.bin /var/log/pgsql/pglog/postgresql-2012-03-23_11.log
        pgbadger -o day1/hour03.bin /var/log/pgsql/pglog/postgresql-2012-03-23_12.log
        ...</code></pre>

<p>When you want to refresh the HTML report, for example each time after a new binary file is generated, just do the following:</p>

<pre><code>        pgbadger -o day1_report.html day1/*.bin</code></pre>

<p>Adjust the commands to suit your particular needs.</p>

<h3 id="JSON-FORMAT">JSON FORMAT</h3>

<p>JSON format is good for sharing data with other languages, which makes it easy to integrate pgBadger result into other monitoring tools like Cacti or Graphite.</p>
