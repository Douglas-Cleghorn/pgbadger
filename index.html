pgBadger is a standalone Perl program that uses a javascript library (flotr2) to draw graphs so that you don't need to install any additional modules or other packages. Furthermore, this library gives us more features such as zooming. pgBadger also uses the Bootstrap javascript library and the FontAwesome webfont for better design. Everything is embedded.
			    </p>
                            <p>
pgBadger is able to autodetect your PostgreSQL log file format (syslog, stderr, csvlog or jsonlog) as well as pgbouncer log file. It is designed to parse huge log files as well as gzip compressed file. See a complete list of features below.
			    </p>
                            <p>
All charts are zoomable and can be saved as PNG images.
			    </p>
                            <p>
You can also limit pgBadger to only report errors or remove any part of the report using command line options.
			    </p>
                            <p>
			    pgBadger supports any custom format set into the log_line_prefix directive of
your postgresql.conf file as long as it at least specify a time escape sequence
(%t, %m or %n) and the process related escape sequence (%p or %c).
			    </p>
                            <p>
pgBadger allow parallel processing on a single log file and multiple files through the use of the -j or -J options and the number of CPUs as value.
			    </p>
                            <p>
If you want to save system performance you can also use log_duration instead of log_min_duration_statement to have reports on duration and number of queries only.
			    </p>
                            <p>
pgBadger supports an incremental mode that allow to construct incremental reports after successives runs of pgBadger. It is possible to run pgbadger each days or even more, each hours, and have cumulatives reports per day and per week. A top index page will allow you to go directly to the weekly and daily reports.

		<h3><code>Version 9.0 - 2016-09-02</code></h3>
                <div class="text-zone">
                            <p>
This major release of pgBadger is a port to bootstrap 3 and a version
upgrade of all resources files (CSS and Javascript). There's also some
bugs fixes and features enhancements.
</p>
<p>
Backward compatibility with old incremental report might be preserved.
</p>
<pre>
  - Sources and licences of resources files are now on a dedicated
    subdirectory. A script to update their minified version embedded
    in pgbager script has been added. Thanks to Christoph Berg for
    the help and feature request.

  - Try to detect user/database/host from connection strings if
    log_connection is enabled and log_line_prefix doesn't include
    them.
    
    Extend the regex to autodetect database name, user name, client
    ip address and application name. The regex now are the following:
    
    	db => qr/(?:db|database)=([^,]*)/;
    	user => qr/(?:user|usr)=([^,]*)/;
    	client => qr/(?:client|remote|ip|host)=([^,]*)/;
    	appname => qr/(?:app|application)=([^,]*)/;
    
  - Add backward compatibility with older version of pgbadger in
    incremental mode by creating a subdirectory for new CSS and
    Javascript files. This subdirectory is named with the major
    version number of pgbadger.
    
  - Increase the size of the pgbadger logo that appears too small
    with the new font size.

  - Normalize detailed information in all reports.

  - Fix duplicate copy icon in locks report.

  - Fix missing chart on histogram of session time. Thanks to
    Guillaume Lelarge for the report.

  - Add LICENSE file noting the licenses used by the resource
    files. Thanks to Christoph Berg for the patch.

  - Add patch to jqplot library to fix an infinite loop when trying
    to download some charts. Thanks to Julien Tachoires for the help
    to solve this issue.
    
  - Script tools/updt_embedded_rsc.pl will apply the patch to resource
    file resources/jquery.jqplot.js and doesn't complain if it has
    already been applied.

  - Remove single last comma at end of pie chart dataset. Thanks to
    Julien Tachoires for the report.

  - Change display of normalized error

  - Remove unused or auto-generated files

  - Update all resources files (js+css) and create a directory to
    include source of javascript libraries used in pgbadger. There is
    also a new script tools/updt_embedded_rsc.pl the can be used to
    generate the minified version of those files and embedded them
    into pgbadger.  This script will also embedded the FontAwesome.otf
    open truetype font into the fontawesome.css file.
